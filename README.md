The Idea
_____________________
The Idea Scrapyard is an open source project to develop a website for sharing ideas. This started out as a project to share tech startup ideas, but now has a larger goal. The Idea Scrapyard wants to be a resource for people working on any idea, startup related or otherwise, in any field.


The Stack
_____________________
The Idea Scrapyard is built on node.js with a redis database using dotcloud.com as a hosting platform.


Future Plans
_____________________
In the future the scrapyard could incorporate:

 * Upvoting/downvoting ideas
 * Comments
 * Editing of ideas to incorporate suggestions presented in comments
 * Search by any keyword within a post, rather than simply tags
 * Search by poster
 * A list of popular or new ideas on the home page (possibly live using now.js)
 * A history browser that allows users to look at how an idea has changed since its original posting.  (The original poster would be allowed to edit the post to include suggestions from comments)
 * A field for the inclusion of a link to a relevant website (an implementation of the idea, for example) on the idea page
 * Idea forking.  Think of the scrapyard as github for ideas.  One could fork an idea and move an idea and its associated conversation in a new direction.
 * An "I want to work on this" button that would collect the names of people interested in working on a given idea and put them in touch with one another.  An instant team-builder.
 * A donate button
 * A bar showing donations compared to money spent by the creators (could include work time @ minimum wage) to encourage donations to cover expenses
 * The ability to follow an idea
 * User profiles
